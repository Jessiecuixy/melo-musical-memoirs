🎵 Melo: Musical Memoirs

Affective Computing Final Project – CS6130

Melo is a prototype system designed to support emotional storytelling and autobiographical memory recall. It integrates:

- Text-based Emotion Recognition

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- LLM-based Memoir Refinement (simulated in demo)

- Emotion-Aware Music Recommendation

The system demonstrates how affective AI techniques can be combined to enhance memory recall, emotional engagement, and narrative coherence in a human–AI interaction setting.

🌟 Features

✔ Emotion Analysis

Powered by HuggingFace DistilRoBERTa emotion classifier.

✔ Named Entity Recognition

Extracts people, places, dates from user stories to support contextual reasoning.

✔ Memoir Refinement (Simulated LLM)

A rule-based refinement module emulates LLM output to ensure the demo runs fully offline.

✔ Music Recommendation

Matches the user’s emotional state with a small emotion-tagged toy song database using cosine similarity.
